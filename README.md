# Problem statement:

Many technical and professional roles require Good typing skills, yet doing these and improving these skills can be challenging. 

# Problem Description: 
Users struggle to find a user-friendly typing speed test platform that offers customization, real-time progress tracking, and engaging features. 
 There is a clear need for a comprehensive and interactive solution to address these shortcomings and provide a seamless experience for users.

# Solution:
To address this, we propose a typing speed tester project which we have named as swift for the hackathon. This project aims to provide a practical tool for Beginners to enhance their typing abilities, aligning with the hackathon's focus on skill development and innovation.

# Current Scenerio

1. Average typing speed of a person which has normal interaction with computer is around 20 to 30 WPM (Words per minutes).
2. By continuing this on this basis of regular practice without using any kind of tool it would take around 4 to 8 weeks (1 to 2 months) on the basis of user to cross the speed of above average speed.

# Why should we learn typing fast ??

1. It impresses people 
As programmer you interact with computer on daily basis and you are sitting in front of it for at least 8 hours a day. 
Now a imagine two programmers Person A and Person B and both of them have similar knowledge . Now they are getting interviewed Person A is slow typist and Person B is fast with keys. 
Now you tell you as a judge for that competition who would you choose ???
Which one will attract you more ???
Person B right!!!

2. Now  every second thing in life is about computers !!!
As a programmer you connect with your computer by means of typing , you code , send mails, messages, etc. 
If you increase the speed at which you interact with computer that means that the computer responds to you faster , your thinking speed matches with the speed of your writing speed.
you overall become more productive.
3. It increases your creativity !!


# Tech-Stack

Tech Stack used in this project is as follows :-

1. HTML(Hypertext Markup Language) :- It is used in making websites because it provides the structure and layout for web pages, allowing developers to create and organize content such as text, images, links, and multimedia elements.

# How it is work ???

1.user will type displayed set of words in the game in the specified time.
